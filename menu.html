            <h1>Menu</h1>
            <p>Menu available during restaurant operating hours. If you have a 
            food allergy, intolerance or sensitivity, please speak to our staff
            about ingredients in our dishes before you order your meal.</p>
            <p>We want to keep all our customers happy, that is why we always 
            use high-quality, fresh ingredients to serve up dishes that manage 
            to be both healthy and indulgent. All our food is homemade and it 
            is important to mention that it is healthier than food cooked with 
            processed ingredients or those stored using preservatives.</p>
            <h2>Classical food</h2>
            <p>In essence, classical Mexican meals are those whole that have
            been eaten daily for years, no matter what season of the year we
            are. They are the meals that your great-great grandmother and 
            grandfather would have eaten.</p>
            <p>Classical foods focused on avoidance of modern and preparing
            and eating foods in the same manner that nourished our ancestors
            and kept them well. In essence if your great-great grandmother
            wouldn't recognize it, don't put it in your mouth.</p>

            <h2>Seasonal foods</h2>
            <p>Seasonality of food refers to the times of year when the harvest
            or the flavour of a given type food is at its peak. This is 
            usually the time when the item is the freshest on the market. And
            each season characterizes for something.</p>
            <dl class="seasons_list">
                <dt>Spring</dt>
                <dd>Leafy greens like chard and arugula should each be in the
                market by the time spring begins.</dd>

                <dd>It is a well deserved respite for many farmers, yet it

            <h2>Recommendations of the chef</h2>
            <p>"When you come to a restaurant sometimes you don't know what to 
            order, or maybe you want to try something innovative. In my 
            personal opinion I always want to try new creations, so if you are
            that kind of person, try me!" Jose Hernadez.</p>
            <p>This section is dedicated to creations of the chef. It will 
            change periodically, according to the creations of the chef.
