            <h2>Mexican markets</h2>
            <p>Mexican Markets are very important to us as a restaurant. 
            Firstly because they are our food providers but also because they 
            are part of the Mexican culture. We need as society not let them 
            disappeared by the big multinational companies, otherwise we'd lost
            a big part of our culture. </p>
            <p>That is why we maintain a close relationship with most of the 
            local markets. We try to buy to all of them, it is important to 
            mention that after a research we found more profitable to make 
            business with the local markets. Go to the <a href="markets.html"> 
            Mexican markets </a>section to know more.</p>
