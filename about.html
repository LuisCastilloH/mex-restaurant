            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>El Castillo's Restaurant is a new concept of food. Its main 
            purpose is to deliver the traditional Mexican food to your place 
            with just a preselection in its webpage. The current system 
            includes only one restaurant but soon there will be more 
            restaurants to cover the whole region.</p>
            <p>El Castillo is located in Xalapa, Mexico. Well known for its 
            authentic Mexican food, pico de gallo, fresh guacamole, Mexican 
            cheese and margaritas. El Castillo has been proudly serving its 
            loyal customers since 2015. We take genuine pride in serving our 
            guests authentic Mexican dishes made with the finest ingredients 
            available.</p>
            <h2>Chef's experience</h2>
            <p>Our head chef, Jose Hernandez was born and lives in Xalapa, 
            Mexico. He's been a high-school professor but also an excellent 
            Mexican foodâ€™s chef. Since he was a child he has enjoyed to cook 
            and learn things about the cuisine of his country. It is important 
            to mention that he owes almost all his knowledge to his mother, who 
            was the best chef in the family and she also was famous in the 
            city.</p>
            <p>He considers himself a simple person, he likes to read, watch 
            movies. When he's asked about his hobbies he always answer that 
            cooking is his main hobby, even though nowadays is his job. But 
            when he is not at the kitchen he enjoys being outside, in the 
            nature. Always trying to knowing more places around Mexico but also 
            from other countries. </p>
            <h2>History of the restaurant</h2>
            <p>El Castillo started to operate in January of 2015, with 4 
            employees. Jose as the head chef, Pedro (his nephew) as his 
            assitant and finally Juan and Paco as the delivery guys. After one 
            year the number of employees has increased, being in total 20 
            employees. This is due to the great customer demand</p>
            <p>This Restaurant revolutionized the concept of Mexican Restaurant. 
            Mainly because of these three concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast way to order food</li>
                <li>Less time of the cooking process</li>
                <li>Takeaway service improved</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Mission Statement and Guiding Principles</h2>
            <p>To establish El Castillo as the principal provider of Mexican 
            food in a fast way while maintaining the best quality. To serve our 
            customers and help our employees maximize their potential.</p>
